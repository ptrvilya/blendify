## Introduction
Blendify is a lightweight Python framework that provides a high-level API for creating and rendering scenes with Blender. Developed with a focus on 3D computer vision visualization, Blendify simplifies access to selected Blender functions and objects.

Key features of Blendify:

1. **Simple interface:** Blendify provides a user-friendly interface for performing common visualization tasks without having to dive into the complicated Blender API.

2. **Easy integration:** Blendify seamlessly integrates with development scripts, implementing
commonly used routines and functions:
    * native support of point clouds, meshes, and primitives;
    * support of per-vertex colors and textures;
    * advanced shadows with shadow catcher objects;
    * video rendering with smooth camera trajectories;
    * support for common camera models;
    * import and export of .blend files for deeper integration with Blender;
    * per-face definition of materials for meshes;
    * support for common rotation representations and look-at utility to automatically setup orientation.
3. **Quick start:** Blendify is easy to get started with and does not require a standalone Blender installation. All you need to do is run `pip install blendify`.

4. **Blendify works in Colab:** check out [our Google Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ptrvilya/blendify/blob/main/examples/ipynb/blendify_colab_demo.ipynb)!


## Installation instructions
### Install from pip (minimal package, no extra dependencies)
```bash
pip install blendify
```
### Install the full package with optional requirements
```bash
pip install blendify[all]
```
The full package includes extra dependencies for utilities, examples and documentation.


## Quick Start
```python
# Script to render cube
from blendify import scene
from blendify.materials import PrincipledBSDFMaterial
from blendify.colors import UniformColors
# Add light
scene.lights.add_point(strength=1000, translation=(4, -2, 4))
# Add camera
scene.set_perspective_camera((512, 512), fov_x=0.7, rotation=(0.82, 0.42, 0.18, 0.34), translation=(5, -5, 5))
# Create material
material = PrincipledBSDFMaterial()
# Create color
color = UniformColors((0.0, 1.0, 0.0))
# Add cube mesh
scene.renderables.add_cube_mesh(1.0, material, color)
# Render scene
scene.render(filepath="cube.png")
```

## Feature walkthrough
Walkthrough of Blendify features with code and commentaries can be found [here](https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/blendify/walkthrough.html).


## Examples
Check examples in our repository [here](https://github.com/ptrvilya/blendify#Examples).

**Note:** Examples require extra dependencies, make sure to install them with `pip install blendify[examples]`

Running examples 4 and 5 requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), running example 5 also requires SMPL model files, please refer to the installation instructions in 
SMPL-X [README](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx#downloading-the-model).


## Changelog
The most recent version of Blendify is **2.0.1**. The 2.0.0 update introduced some breaking changes that are
summarized alongside the overview of the new features in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ptrvilya/blendify/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) file.
